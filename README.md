  2. Go to Command Prompt/Terminal on your computer and enter "pip install pygame".
  3. Then, clone or download this repository.
  4. Drag the icon of the folder to Command Prompt/Terminal and type "python3 main.py"

**If you get any errors please just copy paste the error into Google and press enter.**

## System Requirements

The controls are simple: Just press space to jump. You can also use the Up arrow key.

## Issues

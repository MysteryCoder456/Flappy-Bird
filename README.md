# Flappy-Bird
Welcome to my version of Flappy Bird, the incredibly old iOS game that got removed from the App Store. I wrote this game using Python 3 and Pygame.

# How to install
To install this game follow these steps:

  1. Install the Python 3 Interpreter from https://www.python.org/.
  2. Go to Command Prompt/Terminal on your computer and enter "pip install pygame".
  3. Then, clone or download this repository.
  4. Drag the icon of the folder to Command Prompt/Terminal and type "python3 main.py"

**If you get any errors please just copy paste the error into Google and press enter.**
